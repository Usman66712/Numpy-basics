NumPy Operations Tutorial – FreeCodeCamp (1-Hour Video)

This document explains the Python scripts demonstrating NumPy operations from the FreeCodeCamp 1-hour tutorial. Each Python file includes multiple examples with comments explaining the code line by line.

Project Overview

The project contains multiple Python scripts covering different aspects of NumPy. These scripts together provide a comprehensive overview of NumPy for beginners and intermediate users. The main topics covered include:

NumPy Basics – Introduction to NumPy, creating arrays, and understanding array attributes such as shape, size, and data type.

Array Creation – Creating arrays using zeros, ones, arange, linspace, and random number generation.

Array Operations – Performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arrays.

Indexing & Slicing – Accessing elements, slicing arrays, and using negative indexing.

Reshaping & Flattening – Reshaping arrays, flattening, raveling, and transposing arrays.

Stacking & Splitting – Combining arrays vertically and horizontally, and splitting arrays into multiple parts.

Statistical Operations – Calculating sum, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.

Boolean Indexing & Masking – Filtering arrays using conditions and masks.

Linear Algebra – Performing dot products, matrix multiplication, and computing determinants.

Random Numbers – Generating random integers and floats, and setting seeds for reproducibility.

How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd numpy-tutorial


Install dependencies:

pip install numpy


Run any script:

python script_name.py


Each script contains detailed comments for learning and experimentation. You can modify values and try different operations to better understand NumPy.

Notes

The scripts are designed for learning and practice.

They cover all basic and essential NumPy operations taught in the FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

You can combine multiple operations to explore more advanced data manipulation and analysis.

If you want, I can also rewrite it in an even cleaner “Word doc style” with headings, bullet points, and sections that look like a proper tutorial guide.

Do you want me to do that?
